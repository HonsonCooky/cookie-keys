## Introduction

Welcome to CookieKeys, an incredibly ambitious project where a qualified Software Engineer pretends to be a Computer
Engineer. This is a project born out of necessity and fueled by passion. As a dedicated computer user, my interaction
with the digital world is primarily through keystrokes; Programming in Neovim and browsing the web - the keyboard is my
primary tool of trade. However, the solutions available online have not met my unique needs. This led me to embark on a
quest to build my own keyboard.

Due to a childhood injury, my right arm's rotation and extension is limited, a challenge that many standard keyboards
fail to address. For me, utilizing flat keyboards requires me to manipulate my body into uncomfortable resting
positions; Be it an elevated shoulder, elbow, or slouching to compensate. Furthermore, many split and tented keyboards
will be designed with a 60% layout, where my hand is required to move away from the home row in order to reach certain
keys.

Inspired by the work of Ben Vallack ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RN_4PQ0j1A)), this project will attempt
to create my perfect custom keyboard. The ideal end to this project is a low-profile, wearable, ~40 keys, keyboard.

## Project Goals

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the "CookieKeys" project is to design and build a custom keyboard that addresses specific
ergonomic needs, enhances productivity, and reduces the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSI).

### Key Objectives

- **Ergonomic Design**: Create a keyboard layout that promotes natural wrist positioning and minimizes strain during
  extended typing sessions. Investigate ergonomic principles and incorporate them into the design. Explore split
  keyboard configurations to allow for customizable hand placement.
- **Reduced Key Count**: Leverage the success of the 40% ZSA Planck EZ keyboard, which demonstrates the effectiveness of
  layer-based input. Prioritize essential keys while minimizing unnecessary ones. Implement layers for additional
  functionality without cluttering the main layout.
- **Wearable Technology**: Innovate by developing a wearable keyboard solution. Enable users to interact with computers
  seamlessly, even while on the move. Consider form factors that allow portability and adaptability.

### Learning Goals

- Acquire knowledge in PCB design and fabrication.
- Explore programming techniques for custom key mappings and layers.
- Understand ergonomic principles and apply them practically.

### Success Metrics Reduced discomfort and strain during typing sessions.

Positive user feedback on comfort, efficiency, and usability.
Successful implementation of wearable keyboard technology.
