# CookieKeys

This project is my introduction into building a custom keyboard that fits well into my lifestyle.

# History + Context

During my time as a Software Developer, I've interacted with several different keyboards. Each keyboard has fulfilled some different requirement along my journey through bytes, nibbles, and bits.

- **Dell XPS 15 9560**: This laptop was my starting point coming into University, and my primary device for programming during the first two years. The integrated keyboard was all I used, and it served it's purpose well enough that I didn't really think about making changes.
- **Logitech MK545**: At the start of my third year of University, I purchased and built my very first PC. Priority with my budget went to PC hardware and monitors rather than a keyboard. For the next two years, I would be using this keyboard and muscle memory (like with my laptop) to touch type.
- **Microsoft Sculpt**: Upon starting my first job out of University, the company I worked for generously purchased me a keyboard and mouse set to use at work. Most of my co-workers were using the Microsoft Sculpt, and after trialing the keyboard out for a week I decided to pick it up too. Quickly this keyboard highlighted my improper finger placements. This is where I began my journey into proper fingering, and attempting to be home row bound.
- [**ZSA Planck Ez**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcnMR8D0G5o): With a new found ability to touch type and use proper finger placement, I found myself with a lot of friction in attempting to constantly find special characters. RSI became a concern for me, as such I found the ZSA Planck Ez. The idea being that all keys (including special characters and numbers) would be within reach of the home row. It was around this time that I started to use Neovim as my primary IDE. The combination of Neovim and the Planck meant that interactions with the computer had become very keyboard based.

# Problem Statement

Whilst the Planck keyboard enabled me to shift to a keyboard focused style of computer interaction, it's not the perfect solution for me. A childhood injury has meant that rotation in my right wrist is restricted. Being that this keyboard is flat, I'm required to raise my elbow, or slouch in my chair, to comfortably use it. RSI is no longer a concern, but my shoulder and back could do with something more sustainable.

Having experienced only a small handful of keyboards, I've come to the (albeit premature) design that meets the following criteria:

- The keyboard must be split.
- The keyboard must have at least a 45deg angle.
- The keyboard must be ortholinear.
- The keyboard must use low profile, low resistance keys and switches.
- All keys on the keyboard should be no more than one key away from resting hand positions.
- Custom layouts should be embedded on the keyboard, without requiring the installation of a program.

**_Existing Examples_**

- [**ZSA Planck Ez**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcnMR8D0G5o): An example of a 40% layout, utilizing layers to access more keys. Also and example of an ortholinear layout. _Problem:_ This is not split, and requires a full write rotation to use.
- [**Kenesis Advantage360**](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/adv360pro/): An example of a split, ortholinear layout. _Problem:_ Doesn't come with a low profile switch option. In theory, the Advantage360 is the closest resemblance to a keyboard I intend to make.
